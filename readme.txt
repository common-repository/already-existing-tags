Looks for already existing tags within your posts.


== Description ==

This plugin detects your 'already existing tags' into your post each time you create or edit/save one. The found tags will be automatically assigned.

= Features =

* Easy configuration.
* Allow or block manually added tags; the choice is yours.
* You can choose if the plugin examines the title, the content or both.
* You can activate a filter and select which categories will be affected and which ones will be ignored by the plugin.
* Clean uninstall option: If this option is enabled, the plugin will leave absolutely no traces when uninstalling.
* Visit [digitalemphasis.com](https://digitalemphasis.com) for more info.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'already-existing-tags' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Configure the plugin through the 'Posts -> Already Existing Tags' administration panel.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the automatic tagging function start once the plugin is installed and activated? =
No. By default, 'Turn on' is unchecked and no category is selected.

= From now on I want to examine just the tittle or just the content, but after editing the post all the previous tags are still there, why? =
Because the 'Block manually added tags' option is disabled. With this option enabled, all the previous tags are removed before adding the new ones.

= My language uses non-latin characters. Can I use this plugin? =
Yes. As long as you use valid UTF-8 characters, the plugin will work.
